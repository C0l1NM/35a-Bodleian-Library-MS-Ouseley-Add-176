    "description":"Firdowsi’s Shahnamah often portrays struggles between good and evil such as those of Feridun and Zahhak (Shamsayi, 2017). The image of The Murder  of Iraj is no different as it portrays the moments after Tur murders his brother Iraj. \n\n In the Shanameh Faridun divides his empire up between his three sons. The oldest son, Salm is given the west, the middle son, tur, is given Asia, and the youngest, Iraj, is given Persia. Salm and Tur become upset that Iraj gets Persia which is considered the most important and significant of the three and they plot to murder Iraj. When confronted, Iraj pleads with his brothers to avoid violence and offers them his kingdom to appease them. Tur disregards Iraj’s rationale and ends up stabbing him and then removing his head, which is what is being portrayed in the Image here. Tur and Salm then have a messenger send Iraj’s body back to their father, who is devastated. Faridun decides he wants to seek revenge for Iraj’s murder. To do so, Faridun finds Iraj’s Daughter who eventually gives birth to a son named Minucltihr. When Tur and Salm found out about the birth of Minucltihr they sent an envoy to try and make peace. However, this did not go well and Faridun and Minuclithihr sought their vengeance. War was declared and Minucltihr eventually ended up killing Tur in battle and removing his head, as Tur had done to Iraj (ferdowsi 1905, 171-225)."},

    "description":"The Murder of Iraj show the two brothers Iraj and Tur and it is important to understand who these two are and why the behave the way they do in this image and the story.\n\n   Iraj is the youngest of Faridun’s three sons but is often praised as being the most popular. Iraj, along with his brothers, was married to one of the princesses of Yemen. His name means “noble” and speaks to his character. This is shown once, when Faridun tests the three boys by turning into a dragon and Iraj reacts by yelling to the dragon that they were not afraid of it because they were the sons of Feridun; and again when he is killed by his brother, he never resorts to violence, but instead tries to reason with Tur and tells him that he would give up his power so they could continue to be brothers.\n\n Tur, on the other hand is the middle child and like Iraj marries one of the Yemen princesses. He is known for being rash but brave. This is shown during the same encounter with the dragon (Faridun), as he boldly rushes in to accept the dragon's challenge. His rash behaviour is also displayed when he decides to kill Iraj (Shahbazi 2004).\n\n As stated above the boys are each given individual kingdoms. Iraj is given Persia and Tur China. This decision is made by Faridun because he believes that Iraj is the most righteous and noble of the boys and he should therefore oversee the most important kingdom. This decision ultimately leads to the resentment of Iraj from Tur and Salm and eventually his death."},

    "description":"Iraj, who throughout the Shahnameh is depicted as being quite levelheaded, honourable, and pious, is shown here on the ground as he has just been killed. His appendages seem to rest gently at his side and almost as if he was content before being killed. There does not seem like there was much of a struggle between the two. And this is shown in the text as, while Iraj tries to convince his brother not to kill him he never physically tries to defend himself.\n\nAdditionally, the clothing Iraj wears seems to add itself to this idea that he had no intention of fighting. He does seem to be wearing some sort of armour, but no helmet and it seems like he is wearing less than Tur. Iraj is also not shown with any weapon which shows that he had no intentions of fighting with his brothers. This also lends itself to what Iraj says in the text and the glimpse of what we know about who he is, as even when Tur tries to kill him he uses his words and tells Tur that he does not want to fight with his brothers, and that he would rather give up the kingdom rather than be at odds with Salm and Tur. Iraj’s face even in death seems to be solemn and does not show fear but more of a disappointed expression."},

    "image":"Tur in this image shown in a much more menacing way than his younger and more tranquil brother. He is wearing more armour than Iraj and has the knife he killed Iraj with in his hand. This all shows that he, as the text also describes, intended to kill his brother. Tur is also shown holding his brother's head as if it were a trophy. This gruesome imagery is used to amplify how evil Tur and the act he has just performed is.\n\n The facial expression tur has is this image also makes him look pleased with his actions. He does not seem to show any remorse at all for killing his brother. Tur is displayed flaunting his brother's head around which shows a certain amount of disrespect towards Iraj, even in death, which continues as he sends just the head of Iraj to his father. All together the way that Tur is portrayed in this image does lend itself to the text to show that he truly is the antagonist of this portion of the story, he is selfish, evil and shows little regard for anyone he may harm to get what he wants.",

    "description":"Geography in the image as well as the characters and how they are affected by the geography and culture of the area are important to recognize.\n\nIn the Image there is a large hill in the background. This hill provides two important features in the image. The first is that the hill seems to hide the terrible act taking place. By showing only Tur and Iraj in the image and a horse hidden off to the side the artist suggests that this act was done secretly away from others. However, this is not consistent with the text as the text has them enter a tent and everything takes place inside. In other manuscripts the image of this does take place in a tent. Secondly, like elevating kings or heroes the hill does seem to dwarf Tur, Iraj and the murder itself. This seems to suggest that the act is bad and not to be glorified as well as showing Tur in the same way. \n\nGeography and culture played a large part in the naming of the boys, Faridun intentionally waited to name his sons. When it came time to name them, he also gave them their respective kingdoms which were all tied together. Tur was given his name and the kingdom of China and Turan which is relevant as Turan means hostile and non-Iranina land, which is important to the story (Bosworth, 1992). Iraj was given his name which is related to his kingdom he inherits, Iran, meaning noble (Shahbazi, 2004).\n\nBecause of these links, it is clear that There are geographical aspects to both the image and the story itself that lend to the understanding of the events that take place."},
