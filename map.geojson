    "description":"\"Firdowsi’s Shahnamah often portrays struggles between good and evil such as those of Feridun and Zahhak (Shamsayi, 2017). The image of The Murder of Iraj is no different as it portrays the moments after Tur murders his brother Iraj.\n\n In the Shanameh Faridun divides his empire up between his three sons. The oldest son, Salm is given the west, the middle son, tur, is given Asia, and the youngest, Iraj, is given Persia. Salm and Tur become upset that Iraj gets Persia which is considered the most important and significant of the three and they plot to murder Iraj. When confronted, Iraj pleads with his brothers to avoid violence and offers them his kingdom to appease them. Tur disregards Iraj’s rationale and ends up stabbing him and then removing his head, which is what is being portrayed in the Image here. Tur and Salm then have a messenger send Iraj’s body back to their father, who is devastated. Faridun decides he wants to seek revenge for Iraj’s murder. To do so, Faridun finds Iraj’s Daughter who eventually gives birth to a son named Minucltihr. When Tur and Salm found out about the birth of Minucltihr they sent an envoy to try and make peace. However, this did not go well and Faridun and Minuclithihr sought their vengeance. War was declared and Minucltihr eventually ended up killing Tur in battle and removing his head, as Tur had done to Iraj \(ferdowsi 1905, 171-225)\.

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
