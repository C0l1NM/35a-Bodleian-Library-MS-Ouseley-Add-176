    "description":"Firdowsi's Shahnameh often portrays struggles between good and evil such as those between Faridun and Zahhak (Shamsayi, 2017). The image of The Murder of Iraj is no different as it portrays the moments after Tur murders his brother Iraj.\n\n In the Shahnameh Faridun divides his empire up between his three sons. The oldest son, Salm is given the west, the middle son, Tur, is given Asia, and the youngest, Iraj, is given Persia. Salm and Tur become upset that Iraj gets Persia, which is considered the most significant of the three, and they plot to murder Iraj. When Tur and Salm confront Iraj, he pleads with his brothers to avoid violence and offers them his kingdom to appease them. Tur disregards Iraj's attempts to be peaceful and stabs him. Tur then removes Iraj's head, and this is what is being portrayed in the image here. Tur and Salm then have a messenger send Iraj's body back to their father, who is devastated. Faridun decides he will seek revenge for the murder of Iraj. To do so, Faridun finds Iraj’s daughter, who eventually gives birth to a son named Minuchihr. Tur and Salm find out about the birth of Minuchihr and send an envoy to try and make peace. However, this does not go well and Faridun and Minuchihr continue to seek their vengeance. War is declared and Minuchihr kills Tur in battle. He removes his head, as Tur had done to Iraj (Ferdowsi 1905, 171-225)."},

    "description":"The Murder of Iraj portrays the two brothers Iraj and Tur. It is important to understand who these two were and why the behave the way they do in this image and the story.\n\nIraj is the youngest of Faridun’s three sons but is often praised as being the most popular. Iraj, along with his brothers, are married to one of the princesses of Yemen. Iraj’s name means “noble” and relates to his character. This is shown when Faridun tests the three boys by turning into a dragon. Iraj reacts by yelling to the dragon that they are not afraid of it because they are the sons of Faridun; and again, when his brother, Tur, murders him. He does not resort to violence, but instead tries to reason with Tur. Iraj tells him that he will give up his power and kingdom so they can continue to be brothers.\n\nTur is the middle child and like Iraj marries one of the Yemen princesses. He is known for being rash but brave. This is shown during the same encounter with the dragon (Faridun), as he boldly rushes in to accept the dragon's challenge. His rash behaviour is also displayed when he decides to kill Iraj (Shahbazi 2004).\n\n Faridun gives Iraj Persia because he believes that Iraj is the most righteous and noble and because of this trusts that he will rule Persia justly. This decision ultimately leads to the resentment of Iraj from Tur and Salm and eventually his death."},

    "description":"Iraj, who throughout the Shahnameh is depicted as being quite level-headed, honourable, and pious, is shown here on the ground as he has just been killed. His appendages seem to rest gently at his side and almost as if he was content before being killed. There does not seem like there was much of a struggle between the two. And this is shown in the text as, while Iraj tries to convince his brother not to kill him he never physically tries to defend himself.\n\n Additionally, the clothing Iraj wears seems to add itself to this idea that he had no intention of fighting. He does seem to be wearing some sort of armour, but no helmet and it seems like he is wearing less than Tur. Iraj is also not shown with any weapon which shows that he has no intentions of fighting with his brothers. The text describes Iraj as being passive and wise. by not having a weapon or being prepared for a fight the image is consistent with the text’s description of the scene as well as how Iraj’s personality and mannerisms are described. In the text, as Tur tries to kill Iraj, Iraj tries to talk through the problem to find a solution by compromising. He offers to give Tur and Salm his kingdom, so they do not need to fight over it. Iraj’s face in the image seems solemn and does not show a fearful expression, but one of disappointment."},

    "description":"\"Tur in this image shown in a much more menacing way than his younger and more tranquil brother. He is wearing more armour than Iraj and has the knife he killed Iraj with in his hand. This all shows that he, as the text also describes, intended to kill his brother. Tur is also shown holding his brother's head as if it were a trophy. This gruesome imagery is used to amplify how evil Tur and the act he has just performed is.\n\nThe facial expression tur has is this image also makes him look pleased with his actions. He does not seem to show any remorse at all for killing his brother. Tur is displayed flaunting his brother's head around which shows a certain amount of disrespect towards Iraj, even in death, which continues as he sends just the head of Iraj to his father. All together the way that Tur is portrayed in this image does lend itself to the text to show that he truly is the antagonist of this portion of the story, he is selfish, evil and shows little regard for anyone he may harm to get what he wants."},

    "description":"The geography depicted in the scene is significant. The characters relationship with their names and the regional geography is also important to consider as the relationship has some additional meaning.\n\nIn the image there is a large hill in the background. The hill seems to hide the terrible act taking place. By showing only Tur, Iraj and a horse hidden off to the side, the artist suggests that this act was done secretly away from others. However, this is not consistent with the text as the text has them enter a tent and everything takes place inside. In other manuscripts the image setting of this scene is in a tent.\n\nThe hill also acts to dwarf the murder. Often, images in the Shahnameh will elevate important characters or events to emphasise their greatness. In the same way elevation is used in this image to suggest that the act, and Tur, are evil and not to be glorified.\n\nGeography and culture played a large part in the naming of the three brothers. Faridun intentionally waited to name his sons, so he could name them based on their personalities. When it came time to name them, he also gave them their respective kingdoms. Tur was given his name and the kingdom of China and Turan which is relevant as Turan means hostile and non-Iranian land, which matches Tur’s demeanor (Bosworth, 1992). Iraj was given his name which is related to his kingdom he inherits, Iran, meaning noble (Shahbazi, 2004).\n\nTherefore, the geographical backgrounds in both the image and the story itself have deeper meanings."},

    "description":"As mentioned earlier, the clothing the two brothers wear is important to express their intentions at the moment and to their characters. The limited armor worn by Iraj suggests that he has no interest in fighting, and the opposite is true for Tur. This plays into the type of character the two sons where Iraj is portrayed as well spoken, wise, and just, so would be less likely to have weapons and armour. Tur, on the other hand is constantly shown to be rash and aggressive in nature, so aside from his plan to kill his brother would be more likely to be dressed and carrying such items.\n\n Beyond just what clothes they are wearing is the colour and the patterns on the clothes. Both brothers are shown wearing green clothes, which often in Iranian culture is related to serenity and God/ the heavens (Soucek, 1992). Despite the violence on the surface of this image, this may be important to signify Iraj’s ascension to heaven. His severed head even seems to show a peaceful expression. Additionally, Iraj’s green is accented by red sleeves and pants. The red is often considered to be a colour for martyrs, which Iraj may certainly be considered in this situation.\n\nAs for Tur, like Iraj, he is wearing green. This may be less related to him but more to the overall scene or his brother. However, the accents of his clothes are blue, which often is related to evil death and mourning (Soucek, 1992). This more aptly fits into the role that Tur plays in this image"},

    "description":"The Murder of Iraj is graphic in its depiction of Tur Killing Iraj. In the Image Tur has already murdered and beheaded Iraj. Tur is shown holding Iraj’s severed head up as if it were a trophy and basking in his terrible deed. The image contains large amounts of blood, both coming from Iraj’s body and from his elevated decapitated head. This may have been done by the artist to show the extent of how treacherous this act was.  This imagery of blood is relatable to the text, as the text itself uses blood many times the description of the scene. Iraj asks Tur not to shed his blood twice, and when Tur does end up stabbing and beheading Iraj, the text is quick to use the blood of Iraj to signify his killing. The emphasis on blood in both the text and image also represent Tur, Iraj and Salm’s relationship, because as brothers they do share the same blood.\n\nThe use of blood comes up in the text comes up frequently, but in the Chapter How Iraj was Slain by His Brother, it is most prominently when Iraj pleads with his brother and tells him \"Wouldst have the world? Thou hast it. Shed not blood\" (Ferdowsi 1905, 201).\n\n The use of blood is used as a literal and underlying theme this image and text to symbolically represent the brothers and coveys the horror of the murder.
